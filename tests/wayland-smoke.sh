# End-to-end smoke test for XNote on a real Wayland compositor.
#
# Replaces the old Xvfb + openbox + xdotool harness, which died with the X11
# backend in v3.0.0. Everything here is display-server-real: a headless weston
# provides an actual wl_compositor, and XNote is driven through its own
# interfaces (the single-instance server socket) rather than synthetic input.
#
# There is deliberately NO synthetic input. Wayland has no XTEST, and
# ydotool-style uinput injection is seat-GLOBAL rather than confined to the
# test compositor -- it has escaped into a live desktop session before.
# Clicking and typing stay in a by-hand acceptance pass on a real desktop;
# this script covers everything else.
#
# THERE IS NO TRAY HERE. dbus-run-session provides a session bus but no
# StatusNotifier watcher, so xpad_tray_has_indicator() is false for the whole
# run. That is not incidental -- it decides when XNote is allowed to exit, and
# both phases below are built around it. See the comments on each phase.
#
# Usage:  dbus-run-session -- tests/wayland-smoke.sh /path/to/xnote
# Exits non-zero on the first failed assertion.

# --- the session bus ------------------------------------------------------
# dbus-run-session starts its bus before this script runs, so the bus has the
# caller's environment and passes it to every service it activates. GTK and
# GIO bring up the portals, gvfsd and the accessibility bus, which mount and
# listen under XDG_RUNTIME_DIR: run from a desktop, the live session's, where
# the document portal unmounts the running one to take its place and the
# accessibility bus deletes the live socket when it exits. So give the bus
# this run's directories and compositor before XNote starts; a portal with no
# display drops its Settings interface, and GTK warns. DISPLAY= because the
# bus cannot unset a variable. Refuse a bus with any other name on it: that is
# not dbus-run-session's fresh bus but a desktop's, which this would change.
